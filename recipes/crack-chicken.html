        <h3><em>Easy and delicious recipe that the whole family will love.</em></h3>
        <p>What could be more simple than tossing a few ingredients into a slow cooker and walking away with little-to-no prep? Nothing! And when I tell you that the whole family loves it, I am not lying. Every time I make this recipe it's absolutely <strong><em>devoured</em></strong> within minutes.</p>
        <p>Crack chicken is most commonly served on buns but you can put it on a salad, wrap it in a tortilla, serve it over rice, or eat it on its own! It's very versatile and makes great leftovers (that is, if there <strong><em>is</em></strong> any leftovers). It's great with just the chicken, ranch seasoning, and cream cheese but if you have time and want to add some more flavor, be sure to add the bacon, cheddar cheese, and green onions at the end.</p>
