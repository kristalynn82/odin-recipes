        <h3><em>This quick and easy fruit dip is a perfect addition to a summer picnic.</em></h3>
        <p>When was the last time you ate some fruit? Is it as hard for you to remember to grab and apple or banana as you rush out the door every morning? This dip will solve that problem because you will be thinking--nay, dreaming--about it every second of every day from the moment you try it. All fruit in your home will be devoured. Your spouse will say, "Hey, cool it with the fruit, you're stinking up the bathroom." Your children will walk in on you in the pantry, hovering over a whipped topping container filled with this dip in one hand and an entire pineapple in the other. Friends will begin to avoid you because all you can talk about is this dip. Your parents will call you, concerned, because they'll not have seen a single picture of their grandkids in months but will have had their phones blown up with hundreds of different angles of you dipping strawberries, peaches, apples, melon slices, mangoes, bananas, kiwi, guava, grapes, even pomegranate seeds into this dip.</p>
        <p>Your life will <em>never</em> be the same.</p>
